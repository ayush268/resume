\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
  I have been into coding since 2016. When discussing areas in Computer Science, I am great at Systems (Distributed \& Embedded), Security, Architecture, and Networks. I spent my early years at Quant Trading Firms and Product Companies, even successfully building a deep-tech infrastructure startup from the ground up. Since my initial days of slogging, I explored every field of Computer Science I could get my hands on, from Theoretical to Systems to AI. One of my hobbies is keeping on top of things in the tech world.

  Apart from being a Hardcore Techie, I enjoy engaging in other disciplines to learn as much as possible. And thus, I developed a particular interest in trading during my time at Tower Research Capital. Having worked in diverse environments, I can quickly adapt to any work. Also, my experience makes me great at working as part of a team and my love for teaching in mentoring my peers. My hobbies are reading, music (I can play five musical instruments), painting, cooking, and traveling.

\lettersection{Why Virtu Financial?} %TODO
  Virtu Financial works on the cutting edge, has a fast-paced environment, and focusses on creativity. Even though trades are in huge volumes, they have a lean team working on problems around the board. The systems and algorithms dealing with such diverse securities and trading volumes pose many exciting and challenging issues. I want to be a part of that.

Three essential things that attract me to Algorithmic Trading Firms are
  \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
    \item the people around us,
    \item the challenging plus fast-paced environment/work with significant visible impact, and
    \item ofcourse pay.
  \end{itemize}
  During my time at Tower Research Capital, the people I worked with were like-minded, making it very comfortable and rewarding. Even the teams we work with are small, unlike Product Companies. It feels like a startup with exciting problems to solve every day. Thus, I want to work here after trying different sectors and companies.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
My passion, expertise \& experience in low latency systems is a huge plus point. I enjoy working on challenging technical problems even in my free time; my love for technology comes here. And I am a swift learner and adapt to any environment, which gives me a great headstart on any work I take up.

My prior experience at Tower Research Capital, Eightfold.ai, and building my startup has helped me gain great experience working as part of a team, adapting to changing environments, and even leading a team.

At Tower Research Capital, apart from working on the Trading Platform \& testing out trading strategies, I maintained their entire Trading \& Reconciliation System and even expanded it to enable trading on Taiwan FX \& Crypto Markets like FTX and Huobi. My experience here will be very beneficial.
